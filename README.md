# Among us Experiments

Several of my among us experiments using [skeldjs](https://github.com/skeldjs/SkeldJS).

In regards to crashers/exploits, I'll only post patched ones. The rest will remain
"private" until they are patched.

* `index.js` - host-only crasher
* `index2.js` - ruin games exploit
* `index3.js`- patched tutorial scene method
* `index4.js` - display images using among us characters
